# Frontend Modernization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive requirements for modernizing the Claude-Log-View application's front-end interface while preserving all existing functionality. The modernization focuses on implementing contemporary design patterns, improving user experience, and establishing a modern component architecture that aligns with current UI/UX trends.

The application currently provides log viewing, filtering, search, navigation, and file upload capabilities through a Vue 3 interface. The modernization will enhance these features with modern styling, improved accessibility, and contemporary interactions while maintaining 100% functional compatibility.

**Quality Gate:** This implementation must achieve a 97/100 quality score through comprehensive validation to exceed the 95% threshold for production readiness.
