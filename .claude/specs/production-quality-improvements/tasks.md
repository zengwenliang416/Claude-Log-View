## Implementation Notes

**Priority Order**: Tasks are ordered to minimize risk and ensure dependencies are properly handled. Foundation updates (Phase 1-2) are lowest risk, while environment configuration and integration testing are higher impact.

**Quality Gates**: Each major phase includes validation tasks to ensure quality standards are maintained and no regressions are introduced.

**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing occurs throughout implementation to catch issues early and ensure the 95%+ quality target is achieved.

**Rollback Plan**: All changes maintain backward compatibility and include rollback procedures if issues are discovered during implementation.
