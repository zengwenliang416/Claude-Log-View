# Requirements: Pagination and Filtering Bug Fixes for Vue 3 Claude Log Viewer

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical pagination and filtering issues in the Vue 3 Claude Log Viewer application. The current application suffers from broken message navigation, incorrect filtering behavior, and improper default state handling that prevents users from properly viewing log messages.

## 1. Default Message Display

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see all messages displayed by default when I load a log file, so that I can immediately start reviewing the complete conversation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the system loads a log file, THEN all messages SHALL be visible in the message list by default
2. WHEN no filters are actively selected, THEN the system SHALL display all available messages
3. WHEN the application starts with a loaded file, THEN the first message SHALL be selected and displayed
4. GIVEN an empty filter state, WHEN the user views the message list, THEN all message types SHALL be visible

## 2. "Show All" Filter Functionality

**User Story**: As a user, I want to select "all types" to view all messages at once, so that I can see the complete conversation flow without type restrictions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the user selects no filters (clears all filters), THEN all messages SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN the user clicks "Clear All Filters", THEN the system SHALL show all messages regardless of role or tool type
3. GIVEN multiple message types in a log file, WHEN no specific filters are active, THEN messages of all types SHALL be visible simultaneously
4. WHEN transitioning from filtered to unfiltered state, THEN the system SHALL preserve the current message position when possible

## 3. Proper Pagination After Log Import

**User Story**: As a user, I want messages to be properly paginated after importing a log file, so that I can navigate through messages sequentially using the navigation controls.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN a log file is imported, THEN the navigation controls SHALL correctly reflect the total number of messages
2. WHEN using next/previous buttons, THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct sequential message
3. WHEN the current message index exceeds the filtered message count, THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust to the last valid message
4. GIVEN a set of filtered messages, WHEN navigating, THEN the position indicator SHALL show "current/total" based on filtered results

## 4. Filter-Navigation Synchronization

**User Story**: As a user, I want navigation controls to work correctly with active filters, so that I can browse through filtered results without seeing incorrect messages or navigation states.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN filters are applied, THEN the navigation SHALL only traverse through messages matching the active filters
2. WHEN filters change, THEN the current message position SHALL remain valid within the new filtered set
3. WHEN a filter results in hiding the currently displayed message, THEN the system SHALL navigate to the nearest valid message in the filtered set  
4. GIVEN active filters, WHEN the user navigates, THEN only messages matching the filter criteria SHALL be accessible

## 5. Message List Visibility

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see the correct number of messages in the sidebar list based on my current filter selection, so that I can understand how many messages match my criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN filters are active, THEN the message list SHALL display only messages matching the filter criteria
2. WHEN no filters are active, THEN the message list SHALL display all available messages
3. WHEN filter state changes, THEN the message list SHALL immediately update to reflect the new filter results
4. GIVEN a filtered state, WHEN the user views the sidebar, THEN the message count SHALL match the number of visible messages

## 6. Navigation State Consistency

**User Story**: As a developer, I want the navigation state to remain consistent between filtered and unfiltered views, so that users don't experience confusing jumps or invalid states when changing filters.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN switching between filtered and unfiltered states, THEN the system SHALL maintain logical message positioning
2. WHEN a filter is applied that excludes the current message, THEN the system SHALL navigate to the closest valid message in the filtered results
3. WHEN filters are cleared, THEN the system SHALL attempt to maintain the current message position in the unfiltered set
4. GIVEN an invalid navigation state, WHEN the system detects this condition, THEN it SHALL automatically correct to a valid state

## 7. Filter Count Accuracy

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see accurate message counts for each filter option, so that I can understand the distribution of message types in my log file.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN viewing filter options, THEN each role filter SHALL display the correct count of messages for that role
2. WHEN viewing tool filters, THEN each tool filter SHALL display the accurate count of messages using that tool
3. WHEN filters are applied, THEN the counts SHALL remain accurate and reflect the total available messages
4. GIVEN a loaded log file, WHEN the filter controls are displayed, THEN all counts SHALL be greater than zero for available types

## 8. Performance and User Experience

**User Story**: As a user, I want filter and navigation changes to be responsive and smooth, so that I can efficiently browse through large log files.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN applying or removing filters, THEN the message list SHALL update within 200ms
2. WHEN navigating between messages, THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and immediate
3. WHEN switching between filtered and unfiltered views, THEN there SHALL be no noticeable delay or flickering
4. GIVEN a large log file, WHEN performing filter operations, THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive

## Success Criteria

The bug fixes will be considered successful when:

1. Users can load a log file and immediately see all messages by default
2. The "Clear All Filters" functionality properly displays all messages
3. Navigation controls work correctly with both filtered and unfiltered message sets
4. Message counts in filter options are accurate
5. The current message position is preserved when possible during filter changes
6. No messages are incorrectly hidden when "all types" should be displayed
7. Pagination properly reflects the current filter state

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this bug fix:

1. Adding new filter types or criteria
2. Changing the overall UI layout or design
3. Performance optimizations beyond basic responsiveness
4. Adding new navigation features
5. Modifying the log parsing logic
6. Adding keyboard shortcuts or accessibility improvements
