# UI/UX Improvements Requirements
## Vue 3 Claude Log Viewer - Checkbox State and Layout Optimization

### Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI/UX issues in the Vue 3 Claude Log Viewer application, specifically focusing on two main problems:

1. **Checkbox State Logic Issue**: Filter checkboxes appear unchecked by default even when all messages are displayed, creating a disconnect between visual state and logical behavior
2. **Layout Optimization**: The current visual design needs improvements in spacing, typography, component organization, and overall user experience

The goal is to create an intuitive, visually appealing interface where the default state clearly communicates that "all message types are selected" and the overall layout provides a modern, professional user experience.

## 1. Checkbox State Management Requirements

### 1.1 Default State Behavior
**User Story**: As a user, I want to see all filter checkboxes checked by default when viewing all messages, so that I understand that all message types are currently selected and visible.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** the application loads with no active filters **THEN** all role filter checkboxes SHALL appear checked
2. **WHEN** the application loads with no active filters **THEN** all tool filter checkboxes SHALL appear checked  
3. **WHEN** displaying all 607 messages by default **THEN** the visual state SHALL reflect that all filters are active
4. **WHEN** no filters are applied **THEN** the checkbox state SHALL indicate "all selected" rather than "none selected"
5. **WHEN** a user first sees the interface **THEN** they SHALL immediately understand that all message types are being displayed

### 1.2 Filter Toggle Behavior
**User Story**: As a user, I want checkbox interactions to work intuitively when toggling between filtered and unfiltered states, so that the visual feedback matches my expectations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** I uncheck a filter checkbox **THEN** only that specific message type SHALL be hidden from the display
2. **WHEN** I check a previously unchecked filter **THEN** that message type SHALL be added back to the display
3. **WHEN** I uncheck all filters individually **THEN** no messages SHALL be displayed
4. **WHEN** I use "Clear All Filters" **THEN** all checkboxes SHALL return to the checked state and all messages SHALL be displayed
5. **WHEN** transitioning between filtered and unfiltered states **THEN** the checkbox visual state SHALL always accurately reflect what message types are currently visible

### 1.3 Visual Feedback Consistency
**User Story**: As a user, I want consistent visual feedback that clearly shows which message types are active, so that I can quickly understand the current filter state.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **WHEN** all message types are visible **THEN** all checkboxes SHALL display in the checked/selected state
2. **WHEN** some message types are filtered out **THEN** only the visible message type checkboxes SHALL appear checked
3. **WHEN** hovering over filter checkboxes **THEN** appropriate hover states SHALL provide clear visual feedback
4. **WHEN** filter states change **THEN** checkbox transitions SHALL be smooth and immediate
5. **WHEN** using keyboard navigation **THEN** focus states SHALL be clearly visible and accessible

4. **WHEN** viewing borders and separators **THEN** they SHALL use subtle contrast that enhances organization without being distracting
5. **WHEN** using the "Clear All Filters" button **THEN** it SHALL have appropriate styling that indicates its function and maintains visual consistency

### 2.4 Component Spacing and Organization
**User Story**: As a user, I want well-organized interface sections with appropriate spacing, so that I can quickly locate and interact with different features.
