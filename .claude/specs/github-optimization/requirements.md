# Claude-Log-View GitHub Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for organizing, cleaning up, and optimizing the Claude-Log-View codebase for GitHub presentation. The goal is to transform the current comprehensive but scattered codebase into a polished, professional open-source project with excellent documentation and clean code structure.

The Claude-Log-View is a sophisticated Vue 3 web application for parsing and visualizing Claude Code conversation logs in JSONL format, featuring advanced performance optimizations, comprehensive testing, and modern UI components.
