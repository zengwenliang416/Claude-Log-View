# Filter Layout Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for optimizing the filter layout in the Vue 3 Claude Log Viewer application. The current single-column filter layout in the left sidebar creates an inefficient use of horizontal space, resulting in a long vertical list that reduces usability. This optimization will implement a multi-column responsive layout to improve space efficiency and visual organization.

## Requirements

### 1. Multi-Column Layout Implementation

**User Story**: As a user viewing the Claude Log Viewer, I want the filters to be arranged in multiple columns instead of a single column, so that I can access all filters without excessive scrolling and make better use of the available sidebar space.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the sidebar width is >= 350px, THEN role filters SHALL be displayed in 2 columns
2. WHEN the sidebar width is >= 350px, THEN tool filters SHALL be displayed in 2 columns when there are 6 or more tools
3. WHEN the sidebar width is < 300px, THEN filters SHALL fall back to single column layout
4. WHEN there are fewer than 4 items in a filter group, THEN the system SHALL use single column layout for that group
5. WHEN columns are used, THEN items SHALL be distributed evenly across columns to maintain visual balance

### 2. Responsive Design Adaptation

**User Story**: As a user on different screen sizes, I want the filter layout to adapt responsively to the available space, so that the interface remains usable across all device types.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the sidebar width is >= 400px, THEN the system SHALL support up to 3 columns for tool filters with 12+ items
2. WHEN the viewport width is <= 768px (tablet), THEN the system SHALL reduce to maximum 2 columns
3. WHEN the viewport width is <= 480px (mobile), THEN the system SHALL use single column layout
4. WHEN the sidebar is resizable, THEN column count SHALL adjust dynamically based on available width
5. WHEN layout changes occur, THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and not cause content jumping

### 3. Visual Organization and Grouping

**User Story**: As a user scanning the filters, I want related filters to be logically grouped and visually distinct, so that I can quickly locate and interact with the filters I need.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN displaying filters, THEN role filters and tool filters SHALL remain in separate sections
2. WHEN using multi-column layout, THEN each filter section SHALL maintain its own column grid
3. WHEN columns are implemented, THEN adequate spacing SHALL be maintained between columns (minimum 16px)
4. WHEN items are distributed across columns, THEN related items SHALL be kept together when possible
5. WHEN a filter section has both columns and single items, THEN visual alignment SHALL be maintained

### 4. Space Efficiency Optimization

**User Story**: As a user with a standard sidebar width, I want the filters to utilize horizontal space efficiently, so that I can see more filter options without vertical scrolling.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN using 2-column layout, THEN vertical space usage SHALL be reduced by at least 40%
2. WHEN using 3-column layout, THEN vertical space usage SHALL be reduced by at least 60%
3. WHEN columns are implemented, THEN horizontal space utilization SHALL be at least 85%
4. WHEN filter items have varying text lengths, THEN column widths SHALL adjust to accommodate content
5. WHEN message counts are displayed, THEN they SHALL not cause column width imbalances

### 5. Maintain Usability and Accessibility

**User Story**: As a user with accessibility needs, I want the multi-column filter layout to maintain full keyboard navigation and screen reader support, so that I can use the application effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN using keyboard navigation, THEN tab order SHALL follow logical left-to-right, top-to-bottom flow
2. WHEN using screen readers, THEN filter sections SHALL be properly announced with headings
3. WHEN clicking on filter items, THEN click targets SHALL remain at least 44px in height for touch accessibility
4. WHEN hovering over items, THEN visual feedback SHALL be consistent across all columns
5. WHEN focus is active, THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible in multi-column layout

### 6. CSS Grid/Flexbox Implementation

**User Story**: As a developer maintaining this code, I want the multi-column layout to use modern CSS layout techniques, so that the implementation is performant, maintainable, and follows current best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN implementing columns, THEN CSS Grid SHALL be used for the primary column layout
2. WHEN CSS Grid is not supported, THEN Flexbox SHALL serve as a fallback layout method
3. WHEN rendering filter lists, THEN layout calculations SHALL not cause performance degradation
4. WHEN columns are resized, THEN the system SHALL use CSS transitions for smooth animations
5. WHEN browser support is considered, THEN the solution SHALL work in all modern browsers (Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+)

### 7. Performance and Rendering

**User Story**: As a user with many filter options, I want the multi-column layout to render quickly without layout shifts, so that my interaction with the interface is smooth and responsive.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN the component initially loads, THEN layout SHALL be calculated and rendered within 100ms
2. WHEN filter data changes, THEN re-layout SHALL occur without visible content jumping
3. WHEN column count changes due to responsive behavior, THEN transitions SHALL complete within 250ms
4. WHEN hovering or interacting with filters, THEN there SHALL be no layout recalculations
5. WHEN the filter list is long (20+ items), THEN rendering performance SHALL remain under 16ms per frame

### 8. Filter Section Management

**User Story**: As a user working with different types of logs, I want filter sections to intelligently adapt their column layout based on the number of available filters, so that the interface always makes optimal use of space.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN role filters contain 5 items, THEN they SHALL use 2-column layout with 3+2 distribution
2. WHEN tool filters contain 8-11 items, THEN they SHALL use 2-column layout with balanced distribution
3. WHEN tool filters contain 12+ items, THEN they SHALL use 3-column layout if space permits
4. WHEN any filter section has only 2-3 items, THEN it SHALL use single column layout
5. WHEN column layouts change, THEN the "Select All" button positioning SHALL remain consistent

### 9. Search Integration

**User Story**: As a user searching through filters, I want the search functionality to work seamlessly with the multi-column layout, so that filtered results are displayed clearly regardless of the column structure.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN search reduces visible filter items, THEN column layout SHALL adapt to the reduced set
2. WHEN search results show fewer than 4 items total, THEN single column layout SHALL be used
3. WHEN search is cleared, THEN the layout SHALL return to the appropriate multi-column format
4. WHEN search is active, THEN column distribution SHALL remain balanced
5. WHEN no search results are found, THEN the empty state SHALL span the full width appropriately

### 10. Mobile and Touch Optimization

**User Story**: As a mobile user, I want the filter layout to be optimized for touch interaction while maintaining the multi-column benefits where appropriate, so that I can efficiently navigate filters on smaller screens.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN on mobile devices (< 480px), THEN touch targets SHALL be minimum 48px in height
2. WHEN on tablet devices (481-768px), THEN 2-column layout SHALL be maintained if space permits
3. WHEN using touch interaction, THEN column spacing SHALL accommodate finger navigation (minimum 8px)
4. WHEN scrolling through filters on mobile, THEN scroll performance SHALL remain smooth
5. WHEN orientation changes on mobile, THEN layout SHALL adapt within 300ms
