# Claude Log Viewer Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Vue 3 web application to display Claude Code conversation logs beautifully. The application will parse and visualize JSONL (JSON Lines) log files containing conversation data between users, assistants, and various tools, providing an intuitive interface for navigating and analyzing conversation history.

## Requirements

### 1. Data Processing and Parsing

**User Story**: As a developer, I want the application to parse JSONL log files so that I can view conversation data in a structured format.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1.1 WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL parse the 1639dd6d-38d8-43f7-b2a8-c05225d5b4fd.jsonl file containing conversation logs
1.2 WHEN parsing the log file THEN the system SHALL identify different message types including:
   - summary messages with type "summary"
   - user messages with type "user" 
   - assistant messages with type "assistant"
   - tool result messages with "tool_use_id" property
1.3 WHEN processing each message THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including:
   - timestamp information
   - UUID identifiers
   - parent-child relationships (parentUuid)
   - message roles (user, assistant, tool)
   - session information
1.4 WHEN encountering malformed JSON entries THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue processing
1.5 WHEN the log file is large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient parsing to maintain performance

### 2. Message Filtering and Search

**User Story**: As a user, I want to filter messages by role and tool type so that I can focus on specific conversation segments.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
2.1 WHEN viewing the message index THEN the system SHALL provide role filter checkboxes for:
   - User messages
   - Assistant messages  
   - Tool messages
   - Tool Result messages
2.2 WHEN viewing the message index THEN the system SHALL provide tool type filter checkboxes for:
   - Bash tool
   - Edit tool
   - Glob tool
   - Grep tool
   - Read tool
   - TodoWrite tool
   - Task tool
   - Write tool
2.3 WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL update the message list to show only matching messages
2.4 WHEN multiple filters are selected THEN the system SHALL apply OR logic within filter categories and AND logic between categories
2.5 WHEN no filters are selected THEN the system SHALL display all messages

### 3. Message Navigation and Pagination

**User Story**: As a user, I want to navigate through messages efficiently so that I can browse conversation history systematically.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
3.1 WHEN viewing the message list THEN the system SHALL display pagination controls showing current position (e.g., "1 / 384")
3.2 WHEN clicking navigation arrows THEN the system SHALL move to the previous/next message
3.3 WHEN navigating to a message THEN the system SHALL update the main content area to display the selected message
3.4 WHEN reaching the first/last message THEN the system SHALL disable the corresponding navigation button
3.5 WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support arrow keys for navigation

### 4. Message Display and Visualization

**User Story**: As a user, I want to view message content with proper formatting so that I can easily read and understand the conversation flow.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
4.1 WHEN displaying a message THEN the system SHALL show message metadata including:
   - Message type/role (USER, ASSISTANT, TOOL, etc.)
   - Timestamp in readable format (YYYY/M/D HH:mm:ss)
   - Message UUID for reference
4.2 WHEN displaying message content THEN the system SHALL format different content types appropriately:
   - Plain text content with proper line breaks
   - JSON content with syntax highlighting
   - Code blocks with language-specific highlighting
   - Tool use parameters with proper formatting
4.3 WHEN displaying tool messages THEN the system SHALL show tool names and parameters clearly
4.4 WHEN displaying assistant messages THEN the system SHALL handle both text content and tool use blocks
4.5 WHEN content is too long THEN the system SHALL provide scrollable content areas

### 5. User Interface and Theme

**User Story**: As a user, I want a dark-themed interface that matches the provided prototype so that I have a consistent and pleasant viewing experience.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
5.1 WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display a dark theme interface matching the provided prototype
5.2 WHEN viewing the sidebar THEN it SHALL contain:
   - "Message Index" title
   - Filter controls section
   - Navigation controls section  
   - Message list with timestamps
5.3 WHEN viewing the main content area THEN it SHALL display:
   - Selected message metadata header
   - Formatted message content
   - Appropriate color coding for different message types
5.4 WHEN viewing the top bar THEN it SHALL display:
   - "Claude Log Viewer" title
   - "Load Chat Log" button
5.5 WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback (hover states, active states)

### 6. File Loading and Management

**User Story**: As a user, I want to load different log files so that I can analyze various conversation sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
6.1 WHEN clicking "Load Chat Log" THEN the system SHALL provide a file selection dialog
6.2 WHEN selecting a JSONL file THEN the system SHALL parse and load the new log data
6.3 WHEN loading a new file THEN the system SHALL reset filters and navigation to initial state
6.4 WHEN file loading fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
6.5 WHEN a file is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL update the message count in pagination

### 7. Component Architecture and Styling

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a well-structured component architecture with isolated styles so that the code is maintainable and scalable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
7.1 WHEN developing components THEN they SHALL use Vue 3 Composition API
7.2 WHEN styling components THEN they SHALL use `<style scoped>` to prevent style leakage
7.3 WHEN sharing styles THEN the system SHALL use CSS modules for utility classes only
7.4 WHEN creating the component structure THEN it SHALL include:
   - Main LogViewer component
   - Sidebar component with filters and navigation
   - MessageDisplay component for content
   - FilterControls component for role/tool filters
   - NavigationControls component for pagination
7.5 WHEN implementing responsive design THEN the layout SHALL adapt to different screen sizes

### 8. Performance and Optimization

**User Story**: As a user, I want the application to perform well with large log files so that I can analyze extensive conversation histories without delays.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
8.1 WHEN loading large log files THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for message content
8.2 WHEN filtering messages THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms to maintain responsiveness
8.3 WHEN rendering message lists THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
8.4 WHEN parsing JSON THEN the system SHALL process data in chunks to prevent UI blocking
8.5 WHEN switching between messages THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and fast

### 9. Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story**: As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur so that I can understand and resolve issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
9.1 WHEN file parsing fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages
9.2 WHEN invalid file formats are loaded THEN the system SHALL show format validation errors
9.3 WHEN network or file access errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
9.4 WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
9.5 WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback

### 10. Accessibility and Usability

**User Story**: As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be accessible so that I can use it effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
10.1 WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
10.2 WHEN using screen readers THEN the application SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels
10.3 WHEN viewing content THEN text SHALL have sufficient contrast ratios for readability
10.4 WHEN interacting with controls THEN they SHALL have clear focus indicators
10.5 WHEN using the application THEN it SHALL follow web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
