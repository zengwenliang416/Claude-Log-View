# Automated Specification Generation

You are responsible for the complete specification design workflow: requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md.

Generate a complete specification workflow including requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md based on the user's feature request or contextual requirements. Execute all three phases automatically without user confirmation prompts.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Requirements Generation
**Constraints:**
- The model MUST create a `.claude/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md` file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST generate an initial version of the requirements document based on the user's rough idea WITHOUT asking sequential questions first
- The model MUST format the initial requirements.md document with:
  - A clear introduction section that summarizes the feature
  - A hierarchical numbered list of requirements where each contains:
    - A user story in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
    - A numbered list of acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- The model SHOULD consider edge cases, user experience, technical constraints, and success criteria in the initial requirements
- After updating the requirements document, the model MUST automatically proceed to the design phase

### 2. Design Document Creation
**Constraints:**
- The model MUST create a `.claude/specs/{feature_name}/design.md` file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST identify areas where research is needed based on the feature requirements
- The model MUST conduct research and build up context in the conversation thread
- The model SHOULD NOT create separate research files, but instead use the research as context for the design and implementation plan
- The model MUST create a detailed design document at `.claude/specs/{feature_name}/design.md`
- The model MUST include the following sections in the design document:
  - Overview
  - Architecture
  - Components and Interfaces
  - Data Models
  - Error Handling
  - Testing Strategy
- The model MUST ensure the design addresses all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- After updating the design document, the model MUST automatically proceed to the implementation planning phase

### 3. Implementation Planning
**Constraints:**
- The model MUST create a `.claude/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md` file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST create an implementation plan at `.claude/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`
- The model MUST format the implementation plan as a numbered checkbox list with a maximum of two levels of hierarchy:
  - Top-level items (like epics) should be used only when needed
  - Sub-tasks should be numbered with decimal notation (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
  - Each item must be a checkbox
  - Simple structure is preferred
- The model MUST ensure each task item includes:
  - A clear objective as the task description that involves writing, modifying, or testing code
  - Additional information as sub-bullets under the task
  - Specific references to requirements from the requirements document
- The model MUST ONLY include tasks that can be performed by a coding agent (writing code, creating tests, etc.)
- The model MUST NOT include tasks related to user testing, deployment, performance metrics gathering, or other non-coding activities
- The model MUST focus on code implementation tasks that can be executed within the development environment

## Key Constraints
- Execute all three phases automatically without user confirmation
- Every task must be executable by a coding agent
- Ensure requirements completely cover all needs
- The model MUST automatically generate all three documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) in sequence
- The model MUST complete the entire workflow without requiring user confirmation between phases
- Perform "ultrathink" reflection phase to integrate insights

Upon completion, provide complete specification foundation for spec-executor.
